Is Unicode still cool?  Anyway, I'm freshgum.
I'd say "Nice to meet you", but I don't know who you are (and it's cringe).

GitHub's telling me to put what I'm working on in here, so...
  - Starting a blog!  Will have a link soon.
  - [TypeDI is one of my main projects](https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi) :D

The best way to get in touch with me is via e-mail: `freshgum hyphen bubbles at proton (no space) mail dot com`
