Is Unicode still cool?  Anyway, I'm freshgum.
I'd say "Nice to meet you", but I don't know who you are.

GitHub's telling me to put what I'm working on in here, so...
  - Life! Learning to drive.
  - [TypeDI is one of my main projects](https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi) (we can safely say it's way cooler than upstream)

The best way to get in touch with me is via e-mail: `freshgum hyphen bubbles at proton (no space) mail dot com`
